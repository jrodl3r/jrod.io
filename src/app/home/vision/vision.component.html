<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>Believing that smarter software comes from collective effort and experience, I support and embrace the open source community and standardized web movement. With that same ethos, I actively participate in and contribute to the social web.</p>
<p>My father brought home our first x86 computer when I was a kid, and it changed my life forever. From then on software and human interfaces have persistently fascinated and inspired me.</p>
